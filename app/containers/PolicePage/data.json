  "body": "It’s common for sexual assault survivors to question whether or not they should contact law enforcement and report their assault. While many believe that a survivor should report their assault right away, and may even be frustrated by a survivor’s hesitancy to do so, there are many reasons why a sexual assault survivor may not immediately report the crime. Sexual assault takes an enormous physical and emotional toll on a survivor, who may still be processing what happened, and may not be totally ready to handle retelling their story. In a study by the National Institute of Justice, 42 percent of “physically forced” victims who did not report their assault to the police said they did not make a report because they “did not want anyone to know.” Despite the fact that assault is never the survivor’s fault, someone who has experienced sexual assault may still feel concerned that they will be blamed for their attack.",
