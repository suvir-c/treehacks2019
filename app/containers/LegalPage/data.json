  "body": "Sexual harassment is generally defined as any unwanted or offensive behavior of a sexual nature. Oftentimes when we think of sexual harassment, we think of a situation where an employee is offered an advancement in his or her career in exchange for sexual favors, which is called quid pro quo harassment. When an employee is subject to a pattern of unwanted sexual behavior from another employee, this is also a form of sexual harassment known as a hostile work environment.",
